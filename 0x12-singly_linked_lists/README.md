# Singly Linked Lists
*Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.* - [gfg](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-linked-list/)

This project subfolder contains solution to tasks that demonstrate knowledge and understanding of linked lists.
