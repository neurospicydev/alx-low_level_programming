# Recursion

The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.

This project subfolder contains tasks to demonstrate knowledge and understanding in the implementation of recursion in C.
