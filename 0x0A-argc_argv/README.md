# ARGUMENT COUNT & ARGUMENT VECTORS

This directory introduces the second function prototype of `main()` function in C.

`int main(int argc char *argv[]);` takes two arguments:
- which are the argument count, a count of the number of arguments supplied to the program on the command line
- argument vectors, a pointer to an array of strings of type char which are the arguments.

Additionally, this contains tasks that demonstrate knowledge and understanding of argument count and argument vectors as well as the main function in C Programming.
